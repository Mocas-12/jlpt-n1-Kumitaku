## ✨ Features

- 🧭 **Organized by official question types**: mapped against the JLPT official《大題的測試目標》, it covers all three grammar sections — 問題7 文の文法1 (grammar-form judgement), 問題8 文の文法2 (sentence assembly / 統整文), 問題9 文の文法3 (discourse grammar)
- ⚡ **Quick tactic library**: three-line elimination (接続 connection · 呼応 co-occurrence · 语气 register), a 28-pattern quick reference grouped by near-synonym families, a seven-category trap checklist, and a 110-minute time budget
- 🗂 **Pattern library with recite mode (文法库)**: 287 entries covering the full N1 surface — N1 patterns, literary relics (〜まじき・〜べからず), and the compound particles / N2-carryover forms that keep reappearing in 問題7 options — each with its connection rule, meaning, an original example sentence with translation, near-synonym notes, a high-frequency flag (101 exam hot list) and a 出題基準 badge (99 entries verified against the pre-2010 official《日本語能力試験出題基準》1級 grammar list); **recite mode** hides the meaning until you click, marks patterns as mastered with localStorage progress, offers random pick-drilling, and links every pattern to its same-family drill set
- ⏱️ **Timed practice**: each set carries a per-question time budget with a real-time timer; overtime is flagged in red, reproducing exam pacing
- 🔍 **Per-option explanations**: every distractor is labelled with its trap type (接続不合 / 近義混同 / 呼応衝突 / 時態錯位 / 文体不合 / 語序違反 / 文脈断裂) and the key explains the pattern's connection, co-occurrence and register — not just an answer key
- 🔁 **Mistake-notebook loop**: wrong answers are collected automatically; correct answers push items down the 1→3→7-day spaced-repetition schedule until they graduate; a weak-point profile links straight into targeted drills
- 📊 **Per-type stats**: accuracy progress bars per question type + practice history + daily streak
- 🎲 **Mixed drill & mock exam**: one tap to shuffle 10 random questions, or assemble a 20-question mock following the official 問題7〜9 blueprint with a global timer
- 📥 **Extensible question bank**: paste JSON / upload a file to import your own sets (same ID auto-overwrites); an AI transcription prompt is included for converting your textbooks
- 📴 **Installable & offline (PWA)**: web manifest + a minimal service worker — add to home screen and keep drilling with no network
- 🌓 **Dark mode**: follows the system preference with a one-click toggle — the indigo washi theme re-tuned for night reading
- ⌨️ **Keyboard answering**: press 1–4 to pick options, Enter to submit
- 📝 **Session draft**: unsubmitted progress survives refreshes and tab closes
- 🧳 **Record backup**: export/import accuracy stats, history and the mistake notebook as JSON
- 💾 **Zero backend**: all data lives only in your browser's localStorage — double-click and it works

## 🏷️ The Naming

**Kumitaku（組みたく）** — from *kumitai*, "want to assemble". It is the sibling of [Yomitaku](https://github.com/Mocas-12/jlpt-n1-Yomitaku)（読みたく, "want to read"）: same rhythm, same *〜たい* word formation, and it lands exactly on the official name of 問題8 — **文の組み立て**, sentence assembly. Reading trains you to take sentences apart; grammar trains you to put them together.

The visual identity keeps the manga-washi card language of Yomitaku, swapping the vermilion (朱) for indigo (藍) — a classic Japanese pairing.

## 📚 Question Bank & Copyright

The built-in bank is **26 sets / 132 original questions** (clearly marked as non-past-paper mocks): 60 form-judgement items grouped by near-synonym families (逆接・讓步, 義務・被迫, 敬語 …), 48 sentence-assembly items in the exact official ＊-slot format, and 24 discourse-grammar items over six original passages.

JLPT past papers are copyrighted by Japan Foundation / JEES and commercial prep books by their authors. This site ships none of them. To drill with your own books, transcribe questions into the JSON format and import them on the 真題·題库 page — an AI transcription prompt is provided for one-paste conversion.

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

- **Online**: open [the live site](https://mocas-12.github.io/jlpt-n1-Kumitaku/), add it to your home screen, drill offline.
- **Local**: clone and double-click `index.html` — it just works (`file://` supported).

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
npm install          # dev-only dependency: Playwright
npm run check        # validate the question bank (structure, answers, distribution)
npm test             # run the 19 smoke scenarios against a local server
npm run hash         # rewrite asset ?v= hashes + SW cache name
npm run assets       # regenerate OG banner / icons (needs Chromium)
node tests/server.mjs 8322   # serve locally, then node scripts/make-screenshots.mjs
```

CI (`.github/workflows/static.yml`) validates the bank, runs the smoke tests, fingerprints assets and deploys to GitHub Pages — a merge only goes live when tests are green.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is the built-in bank real past-paper content?</b></summary>
No. Every question is an original mock written against the official test goals and marked 本站原创模拟（非真题）. Past papers are copyrighted and are not included or distributed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does this relate to Yomitaku?</b></summary>
Same author, same training loop, same design family — Yomitaku covers 読解 (reading, 問題10〜12 of the reading section), Kumitaku covers 文法 (問題7〜9 of the language-knowledge section). Drill grammar here, then take your time budget over to Yomitaku for reading.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Where is my progress stored?</b></summary>
Only in your browser's localStorage. Nothing is uploaded. Use the backup export/import on the bank page to move browsers.
</details>

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- No backend, no analytics, no tracking; all practice data stays in localStorage.
- Imported source URLs are restricted to http(s); legacy entries with other schemes are neutralized at render time.
